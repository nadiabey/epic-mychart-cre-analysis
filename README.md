# epic-mychart-cre-analysis
Analyzing computer-readable exports from Epic MyChart (mine and my family's, with permission). CREs come in a .zip file that expand into two folders: EHITables (tsv files containing data) and EHITables Schema (htm files containing documentation). 

TSV files were imported into SQL (data-to-sql-db.py) and schema files were compressed into one codebook file (compress-documentation.sh). Exports generally have the same files but tables may be empty and some exports are missing columns for some tables.

Types of identifiers: account ID (billing), patient ID, patient MRN, record ID (claims), etc.

Some significant tables:
* PATIENT, PATIENT_2, PATIENT_3, PATIENT_4, PATIENT_5, PATIENT_6: patient demographics, primary care provider, SSN, Medicare/Medicaid ID, Advanced Directive status, Citzenship, Adoption/Foster status, Alive/Dead status, organ donor status
